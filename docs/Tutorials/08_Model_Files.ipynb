    "# What is a model file ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Model files are:\n",
    "* python files\n",
    "* are located in a folder of `models` \n",
    "* with a name like `_model_NAMEOFYOURMODEL.py` \n",
    "* They need to contain a dictonnary called `_LOGICS` \n",
    "\n",
    "Once those ingredients are here, CHIMES will do as best as it can to transform it into a model. \n",
    "\n",
    "**The best method is to look at model files** Typically in `models/EXAMPLES`, they are voluntarily written with multiple approaches. Typically, copy-paste `_model___TEMPLATE_.py` to write your own ! You'll have everything there.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Why using python file to declare a model ?* That way, it is easy to interact with the model, loading other models, data, write weird functions...\n",
    "\n",
    "As long as `_LOGICS` is there, you can do your own things inside! In consequence, your model your style. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that there are two method to declare dictionnary in python :\n",
    "*  d = dict( key1 = value1,...)\n",
    "*  d = {'key1':'value1',...}\n",
    "Both are equivalent, choose the one you prefer but be consistent\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## _LOGICS\n",
    "\n",
    "_LOGICS is the core of the model file, and what CHIMES Will interpret deeply. You do not need to detail everything inside (initial values, definition, units, symbol) if it's done somewhere else and accessible !\n",
    "\n",
    "### Categories\n",
    "`_LOGICS` is a dictionnary, that will contains all the logics (equations) of the model. Reading it will allow CHIMES to know what quantities (fields) are needed, as well as their characteristics. It will link a field (key) to a logic or a value\n",
    "`_LOGICS` is divided into categories, typically :\n",
    "* **differential** : the time variation of the field is defined by a logic (the variation of a stock is defined by its flows)\n",
    "* **statevar** : the value of the field is defined by a logic ( what you possess is the sum of your different stock values)\n",
    "* **parameters** : the value of the field has no logics, is exogenous to the system\n",
    "* **size** : special quantities that defines certain dimensions (advanced use only)\n",
    "Any other key will be overlooked (or if mispelled, corrected)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "_LOGICS = {\n",

    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Filling the category\n",
    "\n",
    "for each category [differential, statevar, parameter, size], you can now fill it with fields (Capital, Temperature, price, employment, speed...), and associate it with a function and more. For short functions, you can juste use `lambda` python functions (that are short to write !), or a function defined somewhere else ! \n",

    "#### Adding more information\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to add more informations to the model, you can associate the field to a dictionnary, and add the following keys: \n",
    "* a logic (if it is a state variable or a differential variable) called `func`\n",
    "* a comment on how it is calculated (if it is a state variable or a differential variable) called `com` : is it the application of a definition, the differential logic of the reduced system, the consequence of a stock-flow consistency ? Is it exogenous ? \n",
    "* an initial value per default `initial` if its a differential equation\n",
    "* a value (it its a parameter) called `value`\n",
    "* a definition called `definition` : what this field represent ? \n",
    "* a unit system called `units` : is it a time, the inverse of a time, a money quantity ? The existing units are : [ ]\n",
    "* a symbol called `symbol` : a latex writing if you want something fancy for your plots \n",
    "* a size if your system is a multisectoral/agent based one (multiple entities with the same logic in the system, that can interact with each others), as `size`. \n",
    "* if your field is in `size` and you want the index to have labels, you can put them with `list` ( example : `_LOGICS = {'size': {'Nprod': {'list':['firstsector','secondsector'],[...]},[...]},[...]}`)\n",

    "\n",
    "By default, the system will look for the following entries. If they do not exist, it will invent them. \n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "From this, you can simply do changes on _LOGICS directly, or define another _LOGICS dictionnary with a different name, and merge both\n",

    "* you cannot define a field by a name that is a python keywork ( dict,list, lambda, def ) as you could not call it in a function"
