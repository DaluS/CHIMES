# GEMMES NUMERICAL MODELS FOR MACROECONOMIC AND ECOLOGIC STUDIES 

## WHAT, AND WHY THESE MODELS ? 

### WHAT GEMMES STANDS FOR ? 

GEMMES Stands for :

**G**eneral 

**M**onetary and 

**M**ultisectoral 

**M**acrodynamics for the 

**E**cological 

**S**hift

**The goal** is to give user some insight about the dynamics society could go into with problematic such as : 
* Economic instability (Debt, unemployement, endogeneous cycles)
* Ressource scarcity 
* Climate impact 
* Biodiversity impact 

### IS IT AN IAM AS MANY OTHERS ? 

It is an IAM (Integrated assessment model) but not in the standard way : it is based on dynamical systems rather than intertemporal optimisation. 

As a consequence, the model is much more suited to take into account economy as a part of the world (ecology) rather than seeing the ecology as a part of the economy. 
It is much more convenient that way to couple different disciplines that way. This formulation is also stock-flow consistent : nothing appear or disappear out of nowhere by construction. This is a great help to get closer to a thermodynamic consistent model. 

The economic part is handled through Post-Keynesian approach, particularly efficient on rapidly-evolving, out of equilibrium dynamics with endogeneous crysis. 

In the general methodology, one could see similitudes with 'Limits to growth' but with 50 years of update in term of dynamical systems and interdisciplinary research, and more policy oriented.
The model are based on descriptivity and allow the user to develop normativity.

### WHAT ARE OUR GOALS WITH THE MODELISATION PROGRAM ? 

We aim a three goals : 
* Create a common background that is practical for all disciplines to communicate through one platform and language in coupled models
* Show through simplified models emerging properties in economy, and the potent of post-keynesian models for the economy in the XXI century
* Propose coupled modelisation to show interdisciplinary results with a true strong coupling of disciplines
