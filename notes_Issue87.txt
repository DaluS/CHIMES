CORE:
-----
* Shall we use dparam['eqtype'] = 'parameter' ?


MODELS:
-------
* Replaced _DESCRIPTION by __doc__
* hub.model dict vs str ?
* __ini__.PrintDFIELDS() and subsequent thnigs (_get_summary()) => To be done later
* 'i' vs 'inflation'?
* 'p' vs 'prices'
* 'K' vs 'Capital'
* 'D' vs 'Debt'
* 'N' vs 'Population'
* ...
* 'phinull' defined in G_REduced preset 'badnegociation', but not used...


Class utility:
--------------
* _get_DicOfSameUnits() seems redundant with hub.get_dparam(unit=...)
* fromOldToNewModelFormalism() seems incomplete and unused 
* 'func': funcs['logic']: 2 different names for the same thing!
* Preserving _check_dparam because:
    - more complete checks (better more than less)
    - preserves functionality of load directly from a saved dict


SOLVER:
-------
* RK4 seems to be wrong for some reason => to be done later


PLOT:
-----
* => To be done later

TESTS:
------
* import _core at the top of the file => no


LEFT TO DO:
-----------
* Cycles analysis
* Change system size
* Run multiple systems
* debug solvers
